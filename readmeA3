Hi there, 

This is the Git Hub for my A3 Project. 

There are three files present. 

The file named Power_Angus_A3Project is the code for the system written in Python that runs through Idle. Although, it can be run through any python supporting software.

There are also two JSON files which store the relevent data about products and purchase history.
These files are not essential, as the code should create a new JSON file if it cannot  find one. However, they can be used to show the exact steps i took in the video. 

The project also requires software libraries:
- Pandas
- Json
- Os.Path

Regards,
Angus Power.
